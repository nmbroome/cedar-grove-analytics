# Cedar Grove Analytics — Firestore Schema

## Overview

This document defines the Firestore database schema for Cedar Grove Analytics, a legal time tracking and billing dashboard. The system syncs user timesheet data from Google Sheets into Firestore and serves it to a Next.js dashboard.

The schema stores entry data in **per-month array documents**: all billable entries for a given user and month live in a single document, as do ops entries and 83(b) elections. This eliminates duplication from multiple sync runs and minimizes Firestore reads. The dashboard aggregates data client-side from these entry arrays.

---

## Data Source

Each user has a Google Sheets workbook named `{year} - Invoices ({lastName})` (e.g., `2026 - Invoices (Ohta)`). Each workbook contains one sheet per month (January, February, etc.).

Each sheet has a header row (row 9) with the following columns:

| Columns 1–8 (Billable Work) | Columns 10–13 (Ops Work) | Columns 15–17 (83(b) Elections) |
|---|---|---|
| Client | Ops (description) | Company |
| Date | Category | Name |
| Hours | Date | Flat Fee |
| Billables Earnings | Hours | |
| Billing Category | | |
| Matter | | |
| Reimbursements | | |
| Notes | | |

A single sheet row may contain billable data, ops data, both, or an 83(b) election entry. The sync script parses each row and writes to the appropriate collections based on which columns have data.

Rows 1–8 contain summary totals that are synced as `sheetTotals` metadata on the Firestore documents for dashboard validation:

| Row | Column A Label | Column B Value | Column E Label | Column F Value |
|-----|---------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| 1 | Total Billable Hours | 87.40 | Ops Hours | 102.7 |
| 2 | Billable Earnings | $29,497.50 | Total Hours (Ops/Billables) | 190.10 |
| 3 | Reimbursements | $686 | | |
| 4 | Rate | $337.50 | | |
| 5 | 83(b) Fee Earnings | $162.50 | | |
| 6 | Total Payment | $30,346.20 | | |
| 7–8 | *(blank / section header)* | | | |

**Note:** The Rate field (row 4) represents the attorney's take-home rate, not their billing rate, and is intentionally **not synced**. Some sheets do not have ops or 83(b) sections — those values will be `0`.

### Document ID Format

All per-month documents use the ID format `{year}_{month}` (e.g., `2026_January`). The year is always derived from the spreadsheet name, never from date cell parsing.

### User IDs

User IDs are full names as stored in Firestore: `"Michael Ohta"`, etc. These are used as document IDs in the `users` collection and as the `userId` field on all entry data.

---

## Document: `users/{userId}`

The user profile document. Stores identity, role, billing rate, and performance targets. This document is created and maintained via the admin User Management page (`/admin/user-management`) — the sync script does not read or write to it.

### Document Schema

```javascript
{
  name: "Michael Ohta",                   // string — display name
  role: "Attorney",                        // string — "Attorney", "Legal Operations Associate", etc.
  email: "michael@cedargrove.law",         // string — login email (used for access control)
  employmentType: "FTE",                   // string — "FTE" (full-time) or "PTE" (part-time)

  // Billing rates (one entry per active month)
  rates: [
    { month: "January", year: 2026, rate: 337.50 },
    { month: "February", year: 2026, rate: 337.50 },
    { month: "March", year: 2026, rate: 350.00 }
    // ... one entry per month the user is active
  ],

  // Monthly targets (one entry per active month)
  targets: [
    {
      month: "January",
      year: 2026,
      billableHours: 100,                  // number — target billable hours
      opsHours: 80,                        // number — target ops hours
      totalHours: 180,                     // number — target total hours
      earnings: 33750.00                   // number — target earnings
    },
    {
      month: "February",
      year: 2026,
      billableHours: 100,
      opsHours: 80,
      totalHours: 180,
      earnings: 33750.00
    }
    // ... one entry per month the user is active
  ]
}
```

### User Roles

Current roles include:

- `"Attorney"` — licensed attorneys who bill client hours
- `"Legal Operations Associate"` — operations staff who track ops hours

The role is a free-text field on the user document, not on individual entry documents. The dashboard reads the user profile once and applies the role for display, filtering, and grouping.

### Email & Access Control

The `email` field on the user document is used for access control. When a non-admin user logs in, the dashboard matches their Firebase Auth email against user documents to determine which attorney detail page they can access. Non-admin users are automatically redirected to their own attorney page on login. Admin users can access all pages.

### Employment Types

- `"FTE"` — Full-time employee
- `"PTE"` — Part-time employee

The employment type is set via the admin User Management page. New users default to `"PTE"`. Existing users without the field default to `"FTE"` at read time.

### Rate and Targets

Both `rates` and `targets` are arrays with one entry per active month, keyed by `month` and `year`. This allows rates and goals to change over time while preserving historical values for any given month.

The `rates` array stores the user's hourly billing rate for each month. The rate in the spreadsheet (row 4) is informational only; the Firestore value is the source of truth for the dashboard. When a rate changes (e.g., an annual increase), a new entry is added for subsequent months — previous months retain their original rate.

The `targets` array stores monthly performance goals. These are used by the dashboard to render progress indicators, percentage-of-target metrics, and pacing calculations. Targets can vary month to month (e.g., reduced targets during holidays or ramp-up periods).

The dashboard looks up the rate and targets for the selected month by matching on `month` + `year`. If no entry exists for a given month, the dashboard can fall back to the most recent prior entry or display no target.

---

## Collection: `users/{userId}/billables/{year}_{month}`

Stores all billable time entries for one user for one month as an array within a single document. Each element in the `entries` array represents one row from the billable (left-side) columns of the spreadsheet.

Only rows that have at least one of: client, billable date, or billable hours are included.

### Document Schema

```javascript
{
  // Metadata
  userId: "Michael Ohta",                // string — full user name
  month: "January",                      // string — month name
  monthNumber: 1,                        // number — 1-indexed month (1 = January)
  year: 2026,                            // number — derived from spreadsheet name
  syncedAt: Timestamp,                   // Firestore Timestamp — when this doc was last written
  entryCount: 218,                       // number — length of entries array

  // Sheet summary totals (from rows 1–8 of the spreadsheet, used for dashboard validation)
  sheetTotals: {
    totalBillableHours: 87.40,           // number — from row 1 col B
    billableEarnings: 29497.50,          // number — from row 2 col B
    reimbursements: 686.00,              // number — from row 3 col B
    totalPayment: 30346.20,              // number — from row 6 col B
  },

  // Entry array
  entries: [
    {
      client: "C47 Inc.",                // string — client name
      date: Timestamp,                   // Firestore Timestamp — billable date
      hours: 0.6,                        // number — billable hours
      earnings: 203.00,                  // number — dollar amount (parsed from "$203" format)
      billingCategory: "General Diligence", // string — billing category
      matter: "YC Application Questions",   // string — matter name (may be empty)
      reimbursements: 0,                 // number — reimbursement amount
      notes: "Review corporate records", // string — work description
      sheetRowNumber: 11                 // number — original row in the spreadsheet (for debugging)
    }
    // ... one object per billable row
  ]
}
```

### Field Notes

- `earnings`: Parsed from the spreadsheet's currency format (e.g., `"$709"` or `"$29,497.50"` → `709` or `29497.50`). Stored as a plain number, not a string.
- `date`: The billable date from the spreadsheet. Dates in the sheet are formatted as `M/D` (e.g., `1/2`, `1/14`). The year is appended from the spreadsheet name during sync. Stored as a Firestore Timestamp.
- `matter`: May be empty string if no matter is specified for that entry.
- `reimbursements`: Defaults to `0` if the cell is empty.
- `sheetRowNumber`: The actual row number in the spreadsheet (1-indexed, accounting for the header row at row 9). Used only for debugging and tracing back to the source data.
- `sheetTotals`: Summary values from the spreadsheet header (rows 1–8). Used by the dashboard to validate that computed entry sums match the spreadsheet's own totals. The `totalPayment` field represents the total of billable earnings + reimbursements + 83(b) fees. Not present on documents synced before this feature was added.

---

## Collection: `users/{userId}/ops/{year}_{month}`

Stores all ops (non-billable) time entries for one user for one month. Structure mirrors billables but with ops-specific fields.

Only rows that have at least one of: ops description, ops date, or ops hours are included.

### Document Schema

```javascript
{
  // Metadata
  userId: "Michael Ohta",
  month: "January",
  monthNumber: 1,
  year: 2026,
  syncedAt: Timestamp,
  entryCount: 157,

  // Sheet summary totals (from rows 1–8 of the spreadsheet, used for dashboard validation)
  sheetTotals: {
    opsHours: 102.70,                    // number — from row 1 col F
    totalHours: 190.10,                  // number — from row 2 col F (billable + ops combined)
  },

  // Entry array
  entries: [
    {
      description: "Work on Ironclad incorporation workflow", // string — ops work description
      date: Timestamp,                   // Firestore Timestamp — ops date
      hours: 3.5,                        // number — ops hours
      category: "Systems & Automation",  // string — ops category
      sheetRowNumber: 11                 // number — original spreadsheet row
    }
    // ... one object per ops row
  ]
}
```

### Field Notes

- `description`: The "Ops" column from the spreadsheet — a free-text description of the non-billable work.
- `category`: The ops category (e.g., "Systems & Automation", "Business Development", "Team Meeting", "Billing", "Knowledge Management", "Pro Bono", "Write-Off", "Employee Matters", "Motions/Forms", "Educational Content").
- `date`: The ops date column (the second "Date" column in the spreadsheet). May differ from the billable date on the same row.
- A single spreadsheet row can produce both a billable entry and an ops entry. They share the same `sheetRowNumber` but live in different collections.

---

## Collection: `users/{userId}/eightThreeB/{year}_{month}`

Stores 83(b) election filings for one user for one month. These represent flat-fee administrative filings that are separate from hourly billable work and ops time.

Only rows that have at least one of: company name, individual name, or flat fee amount are included.

### Document Schema

```javascript
{
  // Metadata
  userId: "Michael Ohta",
  month: "January",
  monthNumber: 1,
  year: 2026,
  syncedAt: Timestamp,
  entryCount: 1,
  totalFlatFees: 250.00,              // number — sum of all flat fees in the entries array

  // Sheet summary totals (from rows 1–8 of the spreadsheet, used for dashboard validation)
  sheetTotals: {
    eightThreeBFeeEarnings: 162.50,    // number — from row 5 col B
  },

  // Entry array
  entries: [
    {
      company: "Refer Services, Inc.",   // string — company name
      name: "Renata Yumi Kobayashi",     // string — individual filing the 83(b)
      flatFee: 250.00,                   // number — flat fee amount
      sheetRowNumber: 10                 // number — original spreadsheet row
    }
    // ... one object per 83(b) filing
  ]
}
```

### Field Notes

- 83(b) elections appear in columns 15–17 of the spreadsheet (Company, Name, Flat Fee).
- A single spreadsheet row can have billable data, ops data, and an 83(b) entry simultaneously. Each goes to its respective collection.
- `totalFlatFees` is pre-summed at the document level for quick access without iterating the array.
- Months with no 83(b) entries will not have a document in this collection.

## Dashboard Usage

The dashboard aggregates data client-side from the raw entry arrays. There are no pre-computed summary documents.

| Dashboard View | Data Source | Reads per User |
|---|---|---|
| User profile (name, role, rate) | `users/{userId}` | 1 |
| KPI cards (hours, earnings) | `billables` + `ops` | 2 |
| Progress-to-target indicators | `users/{userId}` targets array (filter by month/year) | 0 (already loaded) |
| Client breakdown table | `billables` entries array | 0 (already loaded) |
| Billing category pie chart | `billables` entries array | 0 (already loaded) |
| Ops category breakdown | `ops` entries array | 0 (already loaded) |
| Daily trend line chart | `billables` + `ops` entries (group by date) | 0 (already loaded) |
| Matter-level drill-down | `billables` entries array | 0 (already loaded) |
| 83(b) election details | `eightThreeB/{year}_{month}` | 0–1 |
| Data validation warnings | `billables` + `ops` + `eightThreeB` sheetTotals | 0 (already loaded) |
| Cross-month trend (e.g., Q1) | Multiple `billables` + `ops` docs | 4–6 |

A typical month view for one user requires 4 reads: user profile, billables document, ops document, and eightThreeB document. The dashboard fetches all three subcollections for each user on initial load.

### Data Validation (Warnings)

The dashboard compares computed entry sums against the `sheetTotals` stored on each document and displays warnings on the team members table and attorney detail pages when mismatches are detected. The following checks are performed:

| Warning Type | Comparison |
|---|---|
| Date mismatch | Entry-level date vs parent document's month/year |
| Billable hours mismatch | Sum of entry `hours` vs `sheetTotals.totalBillableHours` |
| Billable earnings mismatch | Sum of entry `earnings` vs `sheetTotals.billableEarnings` |
| Ops hours mismatch | Sum of entry `hours` vs `sheetTotals.opsHours` |
| 83(b) fee earnings mismatch | Sum of entry `flatFee` vs `sheetTotals.eightThreeBFeeEarnings` |
| Total hours mismatch | (billable hours + ops hours) vs `sheetTotals.totalHours` |
| Total payment mismatch | (billable earnings + reimbursements + 83(b) fees) vs `sheetTotals.totalPayment` |

Warnings only appear when `sheetTotals` are present on the document (i.e., after the sync script has been re-run to populate them).

## Sync Architecture

### Sync Flow

```
Google Sheet → Apps Script → Firestore
                  │
                  ├── 1. Parse sheet summary totals (rows 1–8)
                  ├── 2. Parse sheet entry rows (rows 10+)
                  ├── 3. Separate billable, ops, and 83(b) entries
                  ├── 4. Delete-and-replace: overwrite billables/{year}_{month}  (with sheetTotals)
                  ├── 5. Delete-and-replace: overwrite ops/{year}_{month}  (with sheetTotals)
                  └── 6. Delete-and-replace: overwrite eightThreeB/{year}_{month}  (with sheetTotals, if entries exist)
```

### Year Detection

The sync year is **always derived from the spreadsheet name**, never from date cell values:

```javascript
function getSpreadsheetYear(ss) {
  const name = ss.getName();
  const match = name.match(/\b(20\d{2})\b/);
  return match ? parseInt(match[1], 10) : new Date().getFullYear();
}
```

This prevents year detection bugs when date cells contain ambiguous formats like `1/2` (which could be parsed as any year depending on runtime context).

### Delete-and-Replace Strategy

Each sync overwrites the entire month's document in a single write operation. Because billables and ops are stored as arrays within single documents (not as individual subcollection documents), replacing a month's data is a single Firestore write per collection — no reads required for cleanup.

```javascript
// One write replaces all of January's billable entries
setDoc(doc(db, 'users', userId, 'billables', '2026_January'), {
  entries: [...parsedBillableEntries],
  // ... metadata
});
```

### Cost Per Sync (Per User Per Month)

| Operation | Reads | Writes |
|---|---|---|
| Write billables document | 0 | 1 |
| Write ops document | 0 | 1 |
| Write 83(b) elections document | 0 | 0–1 |
| **Total** | **0** | **2–3** |

### Triggers

- **Daily sync**: Triggered by Apps Script time-driven trigger. Syncs the current month for the active spreadsheet.
- **Manual sync**: `forceSyncSpecificMonth("January")` for re-syncing a specific month.
- **Full re-sync**: Iterates all 12 month sheets and syncs each.

---

## Row Parsing Rules

### Billable Entry (Left Side of Sheet)

A row produces a billable entry if it has at least one of:
- A non-empty `Client` value (column 1)
- A non-empty billable `Date` value (column 2)
- A non-zero billable `Hours` value (column 3)

### Ops Entry (Right Side of Sheet)

A row produces an ops entry if it has at least one of:
- A non-empty `Ops` description (column 10)
- A non-empty ops `Date` value (column 12)
- A non-zero ops `Hours` value (column 13)

### 83(b) Election Entry

Rows with data in columns 15–17 (Company, Name, Flat Fee) represent 83(b) election filings. These are tracked separately and do not count toward billable or ops hours.

### Skipped Rows

- Rows where all relevant columns are empty are skipped entirely.
- Rows 1–8 (summary area) are parsed for `sheetTotals` metadata only — they are not processed as entries.
- Rows after the last populated row in the sheet are ignored.
- Rows with `$0` earnings and no other data are skipped.

---

## Document: `invoices/all`

Stores all client invoice records in a single document as an entries array. Synced from the "Payment Status" sheet tab in the Invoices Google Sheets workbook.

### Data Source

The "Payment Status" sheet has a summary header in row 1 (skipped during sync) and invoice rows starting at row 2. Each row tracks one invoice sent to a client, including its payment status, reminder dates, and receipt dates.

### Document Schema

```javascript
{
  // Metadata
  entryCount: 148,                         // number — length of entries array
  syncedAt: "2026-02-10T12:00:00.000Z",   // string — ISO 8601 timestamp of last sync

  // Entry array
  entries: [
    {
      client: "BuildQ, Inc.",              // string — client name
      amount: 4115.00,                     // number — invoice amount (parsed from "$4,115" format)
      year: 2025,                          // number | null — year the invoice pertains to
      dateSent: "12/3",                    // string | null — date invoice was sent (M/D format)
      status: "Paid",                      // string | null — "Paid", "Not Paid", or "Payment Initiated"
      lastReminder: "1/6/2026",           // string | null — date of last payment reminder
      dateReceived: "2/9/2026",           // string | null — date payment was received
      notes: "Not reminder until end of feb", // string | null — freeform notes
      sheetRowNumber: 9                    // number — original row in the spreadsheet (for debugging)
    }
    // ... one object per invoice row
  ]
}
```

### Field Notes

- `amount`: Parsed from the spreadsheet's currency format (e.g., `"$4,115"` → `4115`). Stored as a plain number.
- `year`: The billing year the invoice belongs to (e.g., `2025` or `2026`). Some invoices from a prior year appear in the current year's workbook.
- `dateSent`: The date the invoice was sent to the client. Format varies — may be `M/D` (e.g., `2/3`) or `M/D/YYYY` (e.g., `1/6/2026`). Stored as-is from the sheet.
- `status`: One of `"Paid"`, `"Not Paid"`, or `"Payment Initiated"`.
- `lastReminder`: Date a payment reminder was last sent. May be `M/D` or `M/D/YYYY` format, or null if no reminder was sent.
- `dateReceived`: Date payment was received. May be `M/D` or `M/D/YYYY` format, or null if not yet paid.
- `notes`: Freeform notes (e.g., payment method details, follow-up instructions). May be null.
- `sheetRowNumber`: The actual row number in the spreadsheet (1-indexed). Used for debugging and tracing back to the source data.
- A single client may have multiple entries in the array (one per billing period or invoice sent).

### Sync Architecture

```
Google Sheet ("Payment Status" tab) → Apps Script → Firestore
                                          │
                                          ├── 1. Read all rows from row 2 onward
                                          ├── 2. Skip rows with no client name
                                          ├── 3. Parse currency amounts, trim strings
                                          └── 4. Overwrite invoices/all with entries array + metadata
```

- **Sync trigger**: Manual — run `syncInvoices()` or `forceSyncInvoices()` from Apps Script.
- **Strategy**: Full overwrite. The entire `invoices/all` document is replaced with the parsed entries array and metadata in a single write.
- **Cost per sync**: 1 write.

## Document: `clientAliases/all`

Stores human-confirmed mappings between Mercury transaction counterparty names and invoice client names. Used by the invoice matching feature on `/admin/invoices` to automatically suggest transaction matches for unpaid invoices.

### Document Schema

```javascript
{
  aliases: {
    "gusto": ["Get Sonar, Inc.", "Safebox LLC"],  // one counterparty → multiple clients
    "goodrec": ["Just Play Apps, Inc."],
    "shopsel, inc": ["Cherry-Pick.com, Inc."],
    // key = lowercase counterparty name
    // value = array of invoice client names this counterparty pays for
  }
}
```

### Field Notes

- **Keys** are always lowercase (case-insensitive matching).
- **Values** are arrays of client names exactly as they appear on invoices. A single counterparty can pay for multiple different clients (e.g., "GUSTO" processes payments for several companies).
- The document is created on first alias confirmation and grows as more matches are confirmed.

### How It's Used

1. **On page load**: The invoices page fetches this document alongside invoices and transactions.
2. **Matching algorithm**: For each unpaid invoice, transactions are ranked as candidates:
   - **Alias match** (highest priority): counterparty name (lowercased) exists as a key and the array includes the invoice's client name.
   - **Name match**: case-insensitive substring match between counterparty name and client name.
   - **Amount match**: transaction amount equals invoice amount.
3. **On confirm**: When a human selects and confirms a match, the counterparty→client pair is added to this document (appended to the array if the key exists, or created as a new array entry).

### Data Lifecycle

- **Created by**: Admin user confirming a match on `/admin/invoices`
- **Updated by**: Each subsequent match confirmation (adds to alias arrays)
- **Read by**: Invoice matching logic on `/admin/invoices`
- **Not affected by**: Invoice or transaction syncs (aliases are independent of sync data)

## Collection: `transactions/{mercuryId}`

Stores bank transactions synced from Mercury's API. Each document represents a single transaction and uses Mercury's transaction UUID as the Firestore document ID. Data is synced via the `/api/sync-transactions` API route, triggered by the "Sync from Mercury" button on the admin transactions page (`/admin/transactions`).

### Document Schema

```javascript
{
  id: "a1f97ca2-0089-11f1-804c-274d5cc3c97c",  // string — Mercury transaction UUID
  amount: -4300.00,                               // number — negative = expense, positive = payment

}
```

### Sync Architecture

```
Mercury API → Next.js API Route → Firestore
                    │
                    ├── 1. GET /api/v1/account/{accountId}/transactions (paginated, 500 per page)
                    ├── 2. Authenticate with Bearer token (MERCURY_API_TOKEN env var)
                    ├── 3. Collect all transactions across pages
                    └── 4. Batch upsert into transactions/{mercuryId} (500 per batch)
```

- **Sync trigger**: Manual — admin clicks "Sync from Mercury" button on `/admin/transactions`
- **Upsert strategy**: Uses Mercury's `id` as the Firestore document ID. `batch.set()` overwrites the full document, so re-running the sync is safe and idempotent.
- **API route**: `POST /api/sync-transactions` — uses Firebase Admin SDK (server-side only)
- **Environment variables**: `MERCURY_API_TOKEN` (Bearer token), `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY` (service account JSON)

### Dashboard Usage

| Dashboard View | Data Source |
|---|---|
| Transaction list table | `transactions` collection (all docs) |
| Summary cards (expense/payment totals) | Computed client-side from `amount` field |
| Filter by expenses/payments | `amount < 0` (expenses) or `amount > 0` (payments) |
| Sort by date, amount, status, counterparty | Client-side sorting on fetched documents |

## Document: `clients/all`

Stores all client records in a single document as an array. Synced from a Google Sheets Apps Script that reads the firm's client tracking sheet and writes to Firestore.

### Document Schema

```javascript
{
  clients: [
    {
      clientName: "Acme Corp",              // string — client display name (primary identifier)
      status: "Active",                      // string — "Active", "Inactive", etc.
      clientType: "Corporation",             // string — entity type
      channel: "Referral",                   // string — acquisition channel
      contactEmail: "ceo@acme.com",         // string — primary contact email
      website: "https://acme.com",          // string — client website
      elDate: "2025-03-15",                 // string — engagement letter date
      notes: "Annual retainer client",      // string — freeform notes
      isIdeal: true,                         // boolean — ideal client flag
      diverseFounder: false,                 // boolean — diverse founder flag
      clientContact: "Jane Smith",          // string — primary contact name
      billingContact: "John Doe",           // string — billing contact name
      billingContactEmail: "billing@acme.com", // string — billing contact email
      phoneNumber: "555-0123",              // string — phone number
      location: "San Francisco, CA"         // string — client location
    }
    // ... one object per client
  ],
  lastSyncedAt: "2026-02-18T19:00:00.000Z", // string — ISO 8601 timestamp of last sync
  totalClients: 47                            // number — length of clients array
}
```

### Field Notes

- `clientName` is the primary identifier used throughout the dashboard for lookups and display.
- All fields are optional except `clientName`.
- The dashboard fetches this single document on load and filters/searches the clients array client-side.

### Sync Architecture

- **Sync trigger**: Google Sheets Apps Script (manual or scheduled)
- **Strategy**: Full overwrite — the entire `clients/all` document is replaced on each sync.
- **Cost per sync**: 0 reads, 1 write.

## Collection: `matters/{autoId}`

Stores matter records used to populate matter dropdowns in the time-tracking Google Sheets. Each document represents one matter and uses a Firestore auto-generated ID. Managed by a Google Sheets Apps Script — the dashboard reads but does not write to this collection.

### Document Schema

```javascript
{
  name: "YC Application Questions",       // string — matter name
  clientName: "C47 Inc.",                  // string — associated client name
  createdAt: Timestamp,                    // Firestore Timestamp — when the matter was created
  lastUsedAt: Timestamp,                   // Firestore Timestamp — when the matter was last used
  createdBy: "Michael Ohta"               // string — user who created the matter
}
```

### Field Notes

- `name` is the matter name displayed in dropdowns and referenced in billable entries (`entry.matter`).
- `clientName` ties the matter to a client. All billable entries for a given matter should share the same client.
- `lastUsedAt` is updated by the Apps Script when an entry references this matter, allowing stale matters to be identified.

### Sync Architecture

- **Managed by**: Google Sheets Apps Script (creates new matters when users enter a new matter name in the sheet)
- **Dashboard usage**: Read-only — the Matters tab aggregates billable entry data grouped by `entry.matter`, cross-referencing this collection for client names.

---

## Collection: `admins/{email}`

Stores admin role assignments. Document existence determines admin status — there are no fields required on the document itself.

### Schema

```javascript
// Document ID: user's email address (e.g., "michael@cedargrovellp.com")
// Document body: can be empty — existence is the only check
{}
```

### How It's Used

- On login, the dashboard checks `getDoc(doc(db, 'admins', userEmail))`.
- If the document exists, the user is granted admin access (all pages, admin panel).
- If it does not exist, the user is restricted to their own attorney detail page.
- Admin documents are created/deleted manually via the Firebase console or admin UI.

## Collection: `driveDownloads/{monthKey}`

Stores Google Drive download events grouped by month. Each document contains all download events for one calendar month across 5 tracked Drive folders. Synced twice daily from Google Drive activity via a Google Apps Script.

### Document ID Format

Month string in `YYYY-MM` format (e.g., `2026-01`, `2026-02`).

### Document Schema

```javascript
{
  month: "2026-02",                          // string — month identifier
  totalDownloads: 87,                        // number — total download events this month
  uniqueUsers: 6,                            // number — distinct users who downloaded
  uniqueFiles: 42,                           // number — distinct files downloaded
  lastUpdated: "2026-02-18T19:00:05.123Z",  // string — ISO 8601 timestamp of last sync

  events: [
    {
      ts: "2026-02-01T09:14:22.000Z",       // string — ISO timestamp of the download
      date: "2026-02-01",                    // string — date only (YYYY-MM-DD, for grouping by day)
      user: "jane@cedargrovellp.com",        // string — email of the user who downloaded
      file: "Engagement Letter - Acme Corp.docx", // string — file name
      type: "document",                      // string — Drive file type ("document", "spreadsheet", "pdf", "presentation", etc.)
      docId: "1aBcDeFgHiJkLmNoPqRsT",       // string | null — Google Drive file ID
      owner: "john@cedargrovellp.com",       // string | null — email of the file owner
      folder: "Engagements"                  // string — tracked folder label
    }
    // ... one object per download event
  ]
}
```

### Tracked Folders

Events are scoped to 5 tracked Google Drive folders:

| Label | Description |
|---|---|
| Administrative | Administrative documents |
| Attorney Employment | Employment-related files |
| Engagements | Client engagement letters and materials |
| Legal Memos | Legal research memos |
| New Client Onboarding | New client intake documents |

### Querying

The dashboard fetches the month documents that span the selected date range, then filters the `events` array client-side by date.

### Sync Architecture

- **Schedule**: Twice daily (7 AM and 7 PM ET)
- **Scheduled sync window**: 1st of current month → now (overwrites current month doc)
- **Backfill**: Jan 1, 2026 → now (overwrites all month docs in range)
- **Cost per sync**: 0 reads, 1–3 writes (one per month touched)
- **Cost per dashboard load**: 1–3 reads depending on date range

## Firestore Indexes

### Required Composite Indexes

None required for the primary dashboard flow. Since each data access reads a single known document by path (e.g., `billables/2026_January`), no query indexes are needed.

### Collection Group Queries

The new schema does **not** use `collectionGroup` queries. All data access is by direct document path. This eliminates the need for collection group indexes and avoids the duplication/stale-data issues that plagued the previous `entries`-based architecture.

---

## Migration from Legacy Schema

### Legacy Schema (Deprecated)

The previous schema stored individual entries as separate documents:

```
users/{userId}/entries/{docId}
```

Where `docId` was `{userId}_{year}_{month}_row{rowNumber}`. This caused:

- **Duplicate documents** from multiple sync runs with different ID patterns
- **Year detection bugs** from parsing date cells instead of spreadsheet names
- **Expensive reads** — the dashboard fetched all entries via `collectionGroup('entries')` and aggregated client-side
- **Stale data** — no cleanup mechanism for orphaned documents

### Migration Steps

1. Deploy the new sync script with the updated schema
2. Run the sync for each user and each month to populate the new collections
3. Verify dashboard reads from the new collections
4. Delete the legacy `entries` subcollections once confirmed
